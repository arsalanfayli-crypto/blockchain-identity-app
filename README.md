# Blockchain Identity Authentication App

This repository contains the implementation of my MSc dissertation project at the University of Manchester (School of Engineering).  
The project explores a **blockchain-based identity authentication system**, where individuals can verify their identity once and securely 
share cryptographic proofs with organizations such as universities, embassies, employers, healthcare providers, and financial institutions.

## ðŸ”‘ Project Overview
- Individuals upload identity documents (e.g., passport, driving licence, university degree).  
- Verification is performed by trusted third-party KYC providers.  
- A cryptographic proof (hash) of the verification is recorded on the blockchain.  
- Users can share their verified status via QR code or API request without repeatedly submitting documents.  

This creates a **tamper-proof, privacy-preserving, and globally verifiable identity layer** powered by blockchain.
